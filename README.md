# GoldenCheetah OpenData

The GoldenCheetah Open Data project was started in January 2018.

It aims to create an open access database of endurance exercise data
for use by amateurs, academics and professionals.

* The data is entirely anonymised, no personally identifiable information is stored or made available.

* We store one file per athlete, with each file containing a summary json plus csv files for each activity

* We publish the actual data to an Open Science Framework project here: https://osf.io/6hfpz/ (DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/6HFPZ)

* From November 2018 we additionally published the data to a publically readable AWS S3 bucket: http://goldencheetah-opendata.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/ 

* This repo provides tools for working with the data. There already is a Python library available, see [documentation](opendata-python/README.md) for more details.
